# giftastic

giftastic is an application that uses the giphy API.  The user can click on a button to see gifs in that topic, or type in a new search term to add a button with that topic.  Once clicked, the top 10 gifs of that topic are displayed with the still image of their first frame.  

Once an image is clicked, the image switches from the static image to the moving gif, and it is stopped when the image is clicked again.
